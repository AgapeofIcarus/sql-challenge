 Project regarding data engineering and analysis for UNCC data bootcamp.
![SQL](https://github.com/AgapeofIcarus/sql-challenge/blob/main/data-mining.jpg?raw=true)

For this project I am an employee of Pewlett Hackard. I have been tasked with arranging data into tables from employee records dated in the 1980s and 1990s. These files, six csvs, must be input through sql to generate the desired results. From this data my employer has requested the following:

*List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary.
*List first name, last name, and hire date for employees who were hired in 1986.
*List the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name.
*List the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
*List first name, last name, and sex for employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."
*List all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
*List all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
*In descending order, list the frequency count of employee last names, i.e., how many employees share each last name.
